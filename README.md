# Gym Management System

## Overview
I have developed the **Gym Management System** as a comprehensive platform to streamline gym operations. This system allows administrators to efficiently manage memberships, trainers, schedules, and payments, ensuring a seamless experience for both gym members and staff.

## Features

### Admin Functionality
1. **Login System**
   - I have implemented a secure login system for administrators to access the management dashboard.

2. **Membership Management**
   - Administrators can add, update, and delete member details.
   - The system provides a view of active members for easy monitoring.

3. **Trainer Scheduling**
   - I designed functionality to create and manage trainer schedules.
   - Administrators can assign trainers to specific members based on preferences or requirements.

4. **Trainer Assignment**
   - The system allows linking trainers to members for personalized coaching.
   - Administrators can view assigned trainers for each member.

5. **Payment Management**
   - I included features to record and track membership payments.
   - Administrators can view payment history and pending dues for each member.
